# Dance with Jasmine redesign

Really this is just me getting used to SCSS and GIT

## Requirements
  * Git
  * Ruby 1.9+
  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
  * [compass](http://compass-style.org/): `gem install compass`
  * [bower](http://bower.io): `npm install bower -g`

## Tips

  * Leave bower-components/stylesheets alone. Edits in _settings.scss and _apps.scss
  * Checkout CSS sourcemaps
  
Keep an eye on changes with Compass- just run the following command:

bundle exec compass watch


## Upgrading
  * Run `bower update` to keep dependencies up to date
